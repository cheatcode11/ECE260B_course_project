**ERROR: (IMPOAX-820):	The OA features are disabled in the current session of Innovus because the oax shared library could not be loaded properly. This could be because your installation was not properly configured. To enable OA features, exit the current session and re-launch Innovus either after fixing your installation by running the Configure Installation phase, or after setting the OA_HOME variable to point to a proper OA installation. Check the "OpenAccess Installation and Configuration Guide" manual for more information.

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'setDesignMode') but the technology file for TQRC extraction not specified. Therefore, going for postRoute (effortLevel low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQRC' for lower nodes.

Extraction called for design 'core' of instances=24642 and nets=26993 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design core.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'.
