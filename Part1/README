Part 1:

//Requirement:
Gate Level Simulation with top module as Core.

//Directories Involved:
Top_Module_Core_Synthesis -> Synthesis with Core as top module (updated RTL)
Top_Module_Core_PnR -> Placement and Routing of Core
Top_Module_Core_Gate_Level_Simulation -> GLS of Core

//Status:
Minor update required.
First 7 outputs of core are correct, the 8th output is delayed by a clock cycle.
